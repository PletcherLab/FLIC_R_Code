## R code for simple FLIC analyses


This guide helps people document code repositories so that they're easy to use and understand. In each section, we outline our strategies for making sure that our code repositories are clear, accessible, and user-friendly.

It’s important to make sure our documentation is clear both for internal and external audiences. As our team expands, we want our new employees to easily find and use our existing codebases.

It's also really important if we want to make outside contributors feel welcome or have outside organizations fork and use our code. ([And we do!](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy/blob/master/policy.md)) Explaining what a project is, why it's important, and how people can help ensures that people can fork and adapt our projects.

(Fork means to copy the code that exists over to your own repo, or repository of code, so that you can adapt or use it as needed.)

This guide also contains a checklist we created that helps ensure our repos are clear, accessible, and user-friendly. Some terminology used may be GitHub-specific, but the concepts are applicable regardless of your version control system or platform. We wrote it so that both non-coders and coders can understand it. (If something is not clear, please let us know.)

We’re sharing it because it we think it’s helpful for lots of organizations, including our own. We know that many of our repos don’t conform to this exact style. By articulating a specific style, we hope this document will also help us improve our own practices.
